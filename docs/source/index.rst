This is the documentation for the ROS2 Fuzzer developed by Alias Robotics.
This fuzzer allows to test ROS applications against limit cases that could cause failures or pose a security risk.
Currently the fuzzer allows to test ROS interfaces of any type by dynamically setting up the fuzz cases for each of the
interface elements.
